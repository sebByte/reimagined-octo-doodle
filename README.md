# reimagined-octo-doodle (electron.js)

A very simple app that has a login from which does nothing, a button that says 'clicked' in the console log when clicked and a list of the available cabins

A short explanation for the shortcomings of the login from is found in renderer.js I'm kind of dissapointed this task turned out this way.
